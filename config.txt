# Configuration file for filtering files based on filename
# Each line represents a filter - files will be processed if their filename contains ANY of these texts
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Leave empty or comment all lines to process all files
# Matching is CASE-SENSITIVE

# Example filters (uncomment to use):
# boundary
# population
# road
# building
# area
